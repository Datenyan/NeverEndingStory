# The Literally Never-Ending Story #
Based on an idea submitted to [Rilin's](http://rtay.io) [Ideas Database - Electronic Access System](https://rtay.io/ideas/), this is a Node.js application that allows for an infinite story to be generated, with each word voted on for a consensus of how the story should go.

The original idea, in it's glory:
>We have a document that is essentially one long story that people can keep adding to forever, the editing process will likely follow a wikipedia-esque or voting approach so the story stays on the rails.
